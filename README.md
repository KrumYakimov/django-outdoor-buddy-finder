# Outdoor Buddy Finder

**Author: Krum Yakimov**

## Introduction

**Outdoor Buddy Finder** is a social platform that connects outdoor enthusiasts, enabling them to find activity partners for adventures such as hiking, kayaking, skiing, and mountain biking. The platform offers key features such as user profiles, connections, event management, reviews, and more, making it a comprehensive tool for outdoor adventure seekers.

This project was developed as part of my final exam for the **"Django Advanced"** module in the [Python Web](https://softuni.bg/modules/139/python-web/1500) course at **SoftUni**. The goal was to showcase my ability to structure Django applications effectively by applying advanced concepts such as the **Django REST Framework**, **Unit and Integration Testing**, and utilizing the **Django Template Engine** to create clean, maintainable, and reusable code.

### Generating a SECRET_KEY for Django

To generate a `SECRET_KEY` for your Django project, you can use Django's built-in functionality. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.

2. Run the Django shell:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell
   ```

3. Execute the following Python commands:
   ```python
   from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
   print(get_random_secret_key())
   ```

4. Copy the generated key, which will look something like this:
   ```
   fQ6yGBkpTc8TzsvuPlpWvK02nvT65dAdBUyXJrQJq45KdZOVbUnm0k3slyMt
   ```

5. Add the key to your `.env` file under the `SECRET_KEY` variable:
   ```plaintext
   SECRET_KEY=fQ6yGBkpTc8TzsvuPlpWvK02nvT65dAdBUyXJrQJq45KdZOVbUnm0k3slyMt
   ```
 

### Running the Application
1. Initialize the database:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. Start the Django server:
   ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
